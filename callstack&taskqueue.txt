///Javascript is single threaded.Only one task can
be executed at a time.so every task is put 
onto the call stack and once it is executed
it is popped off the call stack.once call stack is clear
task queue is looked upon for tasks///

// settimout is a non blocking async Javascript
this is pushed onto to web apis instead 
of call stack.Once the anonymous function is executed
it is pushed onto task queue
